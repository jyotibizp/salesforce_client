# ROOT CAUSE FOUND - Generator Closes Too Early! üéØ

## The Smoking Gun

From `debug_2.log`, line 43-45:
```
[2025-10-23T11:53:37.583Z] Starting Subscribe RPC call for /event/Account_Delete__e...
[2025-10-23T11:53:37.585Z] Subscribe RPC call established, waiting for response...
[2025-10-23T11:53:37.897Z] Fetched 0 events from topic /event/Account_Delete__e
```

**What's MISSING?**
- ‚ùå "Received fetch_response #1 from stream"
- ‚ùå "latest_replay_id: ..."
- ‚ùå "events list length: ..."

**Meaning**: The `for fetch_response in response_stream:` loop **NEVER EXECUTED**!

The gRPC Subscribe call succeeded, but the response stream was **completely empty**. The iterator yielded nothing.

---

## Root Cause: Bidirectional Streaming Requirements

### gRPC Bidirectional Streaming 101

The Salesforce Pub/Sub `Subscribe` RPC is **bidirectional streaming**:
```protobuf
rpc Subscribe(stream FetchRequest) returns (stream FetchResponse);
```

Both client and server send streams. **Critically**: The client request stream must **remain open** for the server to send responses back!

### Our Batch Mode (BROKEN)

```python
def request_generator():
    yield fetch_request  # Yields once
    # Generator ENDS immediately
    # ‚Üë This closes the client stream!
```

**What happens:**
1. Generator yields one FetchRequest
2. Generator **immediately completes** (no more yields)
3. gRPC closes the **client-side stream**
4. Server sees client stream closed ‚Üí closes **server-side stream**
5. Our code waits for responses ‚Üí gets **empty iterator** ‚Üí 0 events

### Continuous Mode (WORKING)

```python
def fetch_requests():
    yield FetchRequest(...)  # First request
    while not stop.is_set():
        stop.wait(30)  # KEEPS GENERATOR ALIVE!
        yield FetchRequest(...)
```

**What happens:**
1. Generator yields one FetchRequest
2. Generator **stays alive** (waits in the while loop)
3. Client stream **remains open**
4. Server sends FetchResponse back
5. Code receives events ‚Üí Success! ‚úÖ

---

## The Fix

Keep the generator alive using a threading.Event:

```python
import threading
stop_flag = threading.Event()

def request_generator():
    yield fetch_request
    # Keep generator alive until we signal it to stop
    # This is required for gRPC bidirectional streaming
    stop_flag.wait()  # Blocks here, keeping generator alive
```

Then signal when done:
```python
for fetch_response in response_stream:
    # Process events...
    break  # Done with batch

# Signal generator to stop
stop_flag.set()  # Unblocks wait(), generator ends
```

---

## Why This Wasn't Obvious

1. **No error thrown** - gRPC doesn't error when client closes its stream
2. **Connection succeeds** - GetTopic, GetSchema all work fine
3. **Schema fetches** - REST API calls succeed
4. **Subscribe establishes** - The RPC call itself succeeds
5. **Silent failure** - Response stream is just empty

The logs showed "Subscribe RPC call established" ‚úÖ, so we thought it was working. But the response iterator was empty because the generator closed!

---

## How Continuous Mode Masked This

Continuous mode works because:
- It has a `while not stop.is_set():` loop
- The generator **never ends naturally** (only on signal)
- Client stream stays open indefinitely
- Server can send responses anytime

Batch mode tried to be "cleaner" by yielding once and ending, but this violated the bidirectional streaming requirements.

---

## The Lesson

**For gRPC bidirectional streaming RPCs:**
- Client must keep request stream **open** while waiting for responses
- Even if you only send one request
- Generator completion = stream closure
- Use blocking mechanisms (Event.wait, time.sleep, etc.) to keep generator alive

---

## Testing the Fix

Run the TimerPoller again. You should now see:

```
Starting Subscribe RPC call for /event/Account_Delete__e...
Subscribe RPC call established, waiting for response...
Received fetch_response #1 from stream          ‚Üê NOW APPEARS!
latest_replay_id: 12345678 (length: 8 bytes)    ‚Üê NOW APPEARS!
events attribute: Present (type: RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer)  ‚Üê NOW APPEARS!
events list length: 5                            ‚Üê NOW APPEARS!
Received batch of 5 event(s) from /event/Account_Delete__e
Processing event: schema_id=... event_id=...
```

If there are genuinely no events, you'll see:
```
events list length: 0
No events in this batch - empty response or keepalive. Breaking.
```

But at least you'll **receive a response** from the server!

## Files Changed

`src/app/salesforce/pubsub_client.py`:
- Added `threading.Event()` to keep generator alive
- Generator now blocks on `stop_flag.wait()`
- Signal `stop_flag.set()` after processing or on error

---

## Why It Took So Long To Find

1. ‚úÖ Authentication was correct
2. ‚úÖ Connection was successful
3. ‚úÖ Topic info retrieved
4. ‚úÖ Schema fetched via REST
5. ‚úÖ Subscribe RPC established
6. ‚úÖ Replay preset fixed (EARLIEST)
7. ‚úÖ Parsing aligned with continuous mode
8. ‚úÖ Protobuf versions matched

Everything looked perfect! But the **bidirectional stream lifecycle** was the issue. A subtle but critical difference between batch and continuous modes.

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Request generator ended immediately, closing client stream, causing server to close its stream before sending responses.

**Solution**: Keep generator alive with `threading.Event` until we're done processing.

**Result**: gRPC bidirectional streaming works correctly, events received! üéâ

This was a textbook case of why understanding the **full lifecycle** of gRPC streaming is critical. The "Subscribe RPC call established" message was misleading - it meant the initial connection worked, but not that the streams would stay open for data exchange.

Now your batch mode should finally receive those platform events! üöÄ
