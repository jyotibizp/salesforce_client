| **Aspect**                           | **Salesforce CDC**                                                                 | **Platform Events**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                         | Automatically tracks changes (create, update, delete) on standard/custom objects. | Custom event schema for business logic; manually published via Apex/Flow.          |
| **Event Source**                    | System-generated from object changes.                                             | Developer-defined and published manually.                                          |
| **Delete Detection**                | Native support via `change_type = "DELETE"` in CDC events.                        | Requires custom logic (e.g., Apex trigger) to publish delete events.               |
| **Topic Naming**                    | `/data/ObjectChangeEvent`                                                        | `/event/CustomPlatformEvent__e`                                                    |
| **Replay Support**                  | Yes, via `ReplayPreset` or `ReplayId`.                                            | Yes, same mechanism via Pub/Sub API.                                               |
| **Retention Window**                | ~72 hours                                                                         | 24 hours (standard)                                                                |
| **Batch Processing Feasibility**    | Limited; best for real-time. Replay possible within retention window.             | Possible if events are published and replayed within 24 hours.                     |
| **Real-Time Subscription Required** | Yes, for reliable delivery.                                                       | Yes, unless buffered externally (e.g., Event Hubs).                                |
| **Azure Deployment Options**        | Azure Container Apps, AKS, VM                                                     | Same: Container Apps, AKS, or VM                                                   |
| **Scalability**                     | Scales with number of objects/topics.                                             | Scales with number of custom events/topics.                                        |
| **Multi-Object Subscription**       | Subscribe to multiple `/data/ObjectChangeEvent` topics.                           | Subscribe to multiple `/event/CustomPlatformEvent__e` topics.                      |
| **Customization**                   | Limited to object schema.                                                         | Fully customizable schema and logic.                                               |
| **Use Case Fit**                    | Best for system-driven change tracking.                                           | Best for business-driven event modeling.                                           |

### ‚úÖ **When to Use What**

| **Scenario**                                                                 | **Recommended Approach**                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| You want automatic tracking of deletes across many Salesforce objects with minimal setup. | **Use CDC**                                     |
| You need custom logic, schema, or want to publish events based on business rules (e.g., only certain deletes). | **Use Platform Events**                         |
| You want to buffer events and process them in batches or integrate with external systems like Azure Event Hubs. | **Use Platform Events with middleware**         |
| You want to track deletes and updates across multiple objects in real-time with native support. | **Use CDC with multi-topic subscription**       |
| You need full control over event payloads and want to enrich events with metadata. | **Use Platform Events**                         |
