Thanks for sharing `cl4.log`. Here's a clear summary of what happened:

---

## ✅ **What Worked**

1. **Authentication via JWT**:
   - The access token was successfully retrieved from Salesforce.
   - The decoded token shows valid fields like `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, and `client_id`.

2. **gRPC Channel Setup**:
   - A secure gRPC channel was successfully established to `api.pubsub.salesforce.com:443`.
   - The `Subscribe` call was made to `/data/EventChangeEvent`.

## ❌ **What Failed**

### gRPC Error:
```
❌ gRPC error: StatusCode.UNAUTHENTICATED - An authentication exception occurred. Provide valid authentication via metadata headers.
```

### Debug Info:
```
Debug info: UNKNOWN:Error received from peer {grpc_status:16, grpc_message:"An authentication exception occurred. Provide valid authentication via metadata headers. rpcId: 17436ced-26f1-4016-80c6-b7912956a989"}
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The token was **valid**, but **Salesforce rejected it during the gRPC call**. This usually happens due to one of the following:

### 🔑 1. **Incorrect `aud` (audience) value**
- Your JWT uses:
  ```json
  "aud": "https://blueowlcrm.my.salesforce.com"
  ```
- But **Pub/Sub API expects**:
  ```json
  "aud": "https://login.salesforce.com"
  ```
- ✅ **Fix**: In `auth/jwt_token.py`, change:
  ```python
  "aud": "https://blueowlcrm.my.salesforce.com"
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  "aud": "https://login.salesforce.com"
  ```

### 🔐 2. **Missing OAuth Scopes or Permissions**
- Ensure your **Connected App** has:
  - `Access and manage your data (API)`
  - `Perform requests on your behalf at any time`
- Ensure the **user** has:
  - API access
  - Pub/Sub API permission set (if required)

## 🛠 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Update the `aud` field** in your JWT payload.
2. 🔁 Re-run the script.
3. 📥 If it still fails, I can help you inspect the Connected App and user permissions.

Would you like help editing the JWT payload or checking your `.env` and `auth/jwt_token.py`?
